/**
 * Interface for a Java implementation of the DFT-Slider. It is used to re-calculate
 * a FT for a moving window, one sample at a time. This is considerably more efficient
 * than re-calculating the current window with FFT. The data is added one by one.
 * All frequencies have zero amplitude and zero phase before sliding samples into the
 * sliders. This however introduces a latancy. The filter latancy in samples
 * (and number of samples used for the calculation) can be calculated by:<br>
 * <br>
 * [the number of frequency components] * 2.<br>
 * <br>
 * The DC component (frequency 0) is added automatically.
 * To use with multi channel samples, see DFTSliderFilter, which wraps the needed number
 * of DFTSliders (EG 2 for a stereo sound signal).<br>
 * <br>
 * NB! Only positive frequencies are calculated.<br>
